## **FAQ**

**Which free grammar checker catches the most errors?**
QuillBot/Scribbr leads with a 20/20 correction score in independent testing, followed closely by LanguageTool at 19/20. Both require no sign-up for unlimited checks, though QuillBot offers more paraphrasing features while LanguageTool supports 30+ languages. Grammarly's free version also performs strongly but caps usage at 150,000 words monthly.

**Do AI writing tools work for non-native English speakers?**
Yes—LanguageTool, Ginger, and WhiteSmoke specifically target ESL learners with translation features and context-aware corrections. LanguageTool supports over 30 languages with seamless switching, while Ginger provides rephrasing options that help users express ideas naturally. Wordtune's tone adjustment also helps non-native speakers match appropriate formality levels.

**Can these tools replace human editors for professional work?**
Not entirely—automated checkers excel at catching mechanical errors and suggesting rephrasing, but they miss nuanced issues like argument logic, factual accuracy, or stylistic preferences. ProWritingAid and AutoCrit provide deeper structural feedback than basic grammar checkers, yet professional editing remains essential for high-stakes documents like legal contracts, academic theses, or published books.
